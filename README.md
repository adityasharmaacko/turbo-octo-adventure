ðŸš€ **Turbo Octo Adventure: Agent Routing via OR-Tools**
=======================================================

**Overview**
------------

Welcome to **Turbo Octo Adventure**, a proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating the power of **Google OR-Tools** for solving complex **routing** and **task assignment** problems. This POC efficiently allocates tasks to agents by considering **skills**, **location**, and **availability** to ensure optimal task assignments with minimal travel.

Additionally, the system tracks **CPU** and **memory usage**, providing valuable insights into performance during the routing process. It is more than just a routing tool---it's a showcase of how **AI-driven optimization** can enhance operational efficiency.

**Key Features**
----------------

-   **Smart Task Assignment**: Automatically assigns tasks based on agent skills, locations, and availability, minimizing travel distance.
-   **Unassigned Task Tracking**: Identifies tasks that couldn't be assigned, highlighting any gaps in your routing logic.
-   **System Performance Monitoring**: Tracks and logs CPU and memory usage during the routing process for better resource management.
-   **Scalable Architecture**: Supports multithreading for faster computation and scalable execution, perfect for growing needs.

**How It Works**
----------------

### **Input Data**

-   **Agents**: A list of agents with details such as skills, location, availability, and task authorization.
-   **Tasks**: A list of tasks requiring specific skills, location, and estimated duration.

### **Processing Steps**

1.  **Distance Matrix Calculation**: Computes the travel distances between agents and tasks using the **Haversine formula**, ensuring accurate estimates.
2.  **Routing Optimization**: Uses Google OR-Tools to:
    -   Minimize travel distances while factoring in agent skills, availability, and task requirements.
    -   Assign tasks to the most suitable agents.
3.  **Performance Monitoring**: Logs CPU and memory usage to track system health during execution.

### **Output Data**

-   **Agent Assignments**: Details of tasks assigned to each agent, including total distance covered and final task locations.
-   **Unassigned Tasks**: A list of tasks that couldn't be assigned due to constraints.
-   **System Usage Logs**: Logs of CPU and memory usage during execution for performance analysis.

cd turbo-octo-adventure

```

### **Configure the Application**

Update the `application.properties` file with your routing settings:

```
routing.penalty=10000
routing.time_limit_seconds=5
routing.thread_pool_size=4

```

### **Build the Project**

Compile the project using Maven:

```
mvn clean install

```

### **Run the Application**

Start the application:

```
java -jar target/route-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

```
